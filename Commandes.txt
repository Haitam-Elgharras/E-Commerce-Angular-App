# To install Angular CLI globally
npm i -g @angular/cli@latest

# To create a new Angular project
ng new my-app

# To run the Angular project
ng serve 
this command will compile and bundle the application and start the server

# To build the Angular project
ng build

# install bootstrap
npm install bootstrap --save

# create complete component from CLI
    ng generate component component-name
    ng g c component-name


# string interpolation
    {{ data }}

# property binding
    [property]="data"
or  bind-property="data"

example : <img [src]="imagePath">
          <img bind-src="imagePath">


# event binding
    (event)="expression"

# Two way binding
    [(ngModel)]="data"
or [prop]="data" (Click)="propChange($event)"

# Directives
1- component directive : add a component to the DOM
    for example <app-root></app-root>
    
2- attribute directive : change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive
    for example ngStyle, ngClass
    [ngStyle]="{color: isGreen ? 'green' : 'red'}"

3- structural directive: change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements 
   for example *ngIf, *ngFor

# Communication between components
1- from parent to child
in the class of the child component we decorate the property with @Input() decorator
    @Input() 
    item: string;

in the html of the parent component we pass the data to the child component
    <app-child *ngFor="let item of items" [item]="item"></app-child>
or 
    <app-child item="item"></app-child>

the items is an array of strings in the class of the parent component for example

2- from child to parent via event binding
in the class of the child component we decorate the property with @Output() decorator
    @Output() 
    newItemEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

onEvent() {
    this.newItemEvent.emit(this.item);
}

so the parent component can listen to the event newItemEvent and can receive 
the emitted data from the child component


# Template reference variables
    <input #myInput type="text">
    <button (click)="logMessage(myInput.value)">Log</button>

    logMessage(value) {
        console.log(value);
    }
it stores to a DOM element a component or a directive on which we have defined it 
and we can access it in the template


# viewChild decorator
    @ViewChild('myInput'): will give us access to the DOM element or the component or the directive which have a template reference variable
    called myInput (#myInput) it returns the first element that matches the selector

The view child allows us to access the DOM element without the need of waiting of an event to be triggered

# viewChildren decorator
    @ViewChildren('myInput'): will give us access to the DOM elements or the components or the directives which 
    have a template reference variable
    called myInput (#myInput) it returns a QueryList of elements that matches the selector
    it has only one optional parameter( read: boolean) which is false by default.
    the elements will be initialized only when a change detection cycle is triggered unlike the viewChild
    where we have the static flag to choice when we want the element to be initialized

# ng-template

    <ng-template #templateRef>
        <h2>Template Reference</h2>
    </ng-template>

    <div *ngIf="display; then templateRef else elseBlock"></div>

    <ng-template #elseBlock>
        <h2>Else Block</h2>
    </ng-template>

    the whole div will be replaced by the content of one of the ng-template based on the condition
